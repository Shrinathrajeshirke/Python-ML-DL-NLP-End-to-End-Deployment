## 🎯 Key Skillsets Demonstrated

This bootcamp was strategically used to refresh core concepts and integrate production-ready, forward-looking skills:

### 1. Advanced Machine Learning
* **Ensemble Methods:** Deep dive into high-performance models including **Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)** and **Bagging (e.g., Random Forest)** techniques.
* **Targeted Refinement:** Strengthening foundational skills, including advanced **Python** concepts for robust ML pipeline development.

### 2. MLOps & Deployment (Production Focus)
* **Containerization:** Full model deployment using **Docker** for creating reproducible environments.
* **Version Control:** Utilizing **Git** for collaborative development and model/data versioning.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Practical experience deploying end-to-end ML projects on **AWS**.
* Bridging the gap between the modeling notebook and production environment.

### 3. Deep Learning & Generative AI Foundations
* **Core Architectures:** Implementation of modern NLP models based on **Deep Learning** techniques.
* **Transformers:** Detailed understanding and application of the **Encoder-Decoder, Attention, and Transformer mechanism**—the fundamental concepts driving modern Generative AI.
